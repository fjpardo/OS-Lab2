To run the code,

If you are running the code on terminal, or on crackle, follow these steps:

1. Once you have my code uploaded to the crackle server, or have reached the designated directory where my program is you can begin.

2. type in "javac Banker.java" then press enter

3. you may get this prompt, ignore it
	Note: TwoPassLinker.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
	Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

4. then type in "java Banker <Filename>" then press enter.

	For example: java Banker input-05      (for input-05)


5. See your results!



Things to note.

My code's out put is something like this, for input-05, I am mentioning this because my code does not print in horizontal form. It outputs vertically like this.
